# ime403_chromeextension
This chrome extension is a basic personal budget tracker that allows the user to input budget maximums and individual expenses during a set time period.

Some features include: Selection of length of time period, progress bar showing the amount spent in comparison to the users set budget maximum, adding expenses & setting budget maximums, editing/deleting expenses.

Currently the process is manual but our team hopes to include automation of inputing expenses in future updates.

How to use this extension:
Download all files and place them into one folder that contains nothing else but these files(ensure the names of these files remain the same). Once you do that look up the chrome extension page (chrome://extensions/)
and select load unpacked. Upload that folder to your extension dashboard. From there, whenever you are in chrome click the puzzle piece in the top right corner of the browser and select "Budget Tracker". A popup will appear and from there you can add expenses (in the format Apples:10), set budget maximums, and set your length of time period you want your budget to be reset at. You can further edit/delete these expenses and you may toggle between tabs to manage expenses and budgets in each each tab individually.

We hope you enjoy! Let us know if you come accross and bugs, fixes, and send over recommendations/feedback!
